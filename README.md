## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam Bardsley, and I am a sophomore studying computer science at Western Washington University.

I am currently working on my two browser extensions, Control for Instagram and Control for Reddit, both of which use JavaScript to block aspects of social media sites in order to make them less distracting. Outside of polishing these extensions, I am considering ways to make even more effective solutions to the problem of social media addiction to help people take back control of their time. 

I am seeking opportunities to build my coding skills.
